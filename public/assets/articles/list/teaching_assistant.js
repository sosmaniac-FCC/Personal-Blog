Teaching Assistant
==================
##### 09/03/2018

From my perspective as a student, the classroom is no big deal. When asked to teach, the classroom becomes something else. My perspective shifts to teacher. I have to be more involved than ever before if I want the class to succeed.

The class does not succeed without enough engagement. I believe classroom success corresponds the level of student engagement. So, I want every student involved throughout the duration of the class. I am not alone in this desire. Me and my assigned partner must work together to engage the students.

It helps to have a plan going into the classroom. The plan is simple, and it includes frequent interaction with the class. At the start of class, the students must quiet down, acknowledge their goal, and listen to further instructions. After that, it is a matter of us, the instructors, looking as bored as possible.

Of course, looks can be deceiving. I was advised, "looking bored leads to more questions". Based off last week's class, this advice is true. Students asked many questions as me and my partner patrolled the classroom. Looks of sheer boredom seemed to motivate students to pull us aside and ask away.

Answering people's questions was the most fulfilling part of teaching class. It was my first time teaching a class so I had no idea of its satisfaction. Feigning boredom is a small price to pay for such satisfaction.

The hardest part was moments before the start of class. Everything up until the last minute was going wrong. I remember how desperate I was to get the projector working by the beginning of class. I was up-and-running two minutes after the fact. I was lucky to find someone next-door who knew how to fix the projector.

The rest of the class went very smoothly. The class moved from introductions to the end of class without issue. Granted, the first class is always the easiest in terms of coursework. I guess the true test of a class' mettle arises as assignments grow in complexity. I assume student perseverance plus instructor competence will determine the class' effectiveness.

I say "I assume" and "I guess" to communicate my lack of experience. Last week was only one of many classes to come. I hope to witness lots of student success. I am responsible for part of that success moving forward.

The students showed many positive signs and habits in class. They were a little rowdy at first. They quickly settled down when I asked their attention. This makes me optimistic for the students' future. They can focus, work together, and produce results. Most of the class finished their assignments by the ending of class. Those who did not finish were just as admirable.

Another mistake I made: misplacing the instructions provided by the supervising professor. I had a decent memory of most of the instructions, but there were a couple things I forgot to go over in class. Thankfully, my class uses Piazza as a social forum for facilitating class communication. Students can answer each others questions on Piazza. Instructors can also answer questions and make general announcements. I used Piazza this past week to notify students of details I missed mentioning in class.

Another nice thing about teaching is the pay. The opportunity to earn money while sharing my passion for technology is a blessing. I only work 15-20 hours a week too. This leaves me with enough time to tackle my classes plus a few other obligations.

Granted, pay is definitely not the main motivation. I worked in a grocery store long enough to appreciate the importance of relevant work experience. For anyone considering a teacher assistant position, remember that teaching is one of the most sought after skills. Learning is good but teaching assures a thorough understanding of the material. No one wants to teach nonsense.

Alright, that is it for this week. I wish I had more to say on the matter. I think I will revisit the subject following the semester's conclusion. For now, it is time to circle back to the Life & Wellness category. I will write about some of my life habits next week. I consider some habits worthwhile to succeed while others not-so-much. Come back next week to find out more!
