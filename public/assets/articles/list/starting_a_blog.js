Starting a Blog

### Introduction

Writing clarifies my thinking. My mind is a jumble of thoughts, fears, and ambitions lacking organization. Committing the jumble to paper helps me sort everything out. To that end, I am using a word processor in place of paper to produce this blog.

I know have an outlet for typing things down. Foregoing the pen and paper for keyboard and screen does not change much. The means are inconsequential to the act of writing. I will mostly refer to it as blog posting given the context of this website.

This blog website acts as a public display for my writing. Each post will derive from my own thoughts based on recent experiences. I will attempt to capture my opinions overtime. A mental timeline in the form of my blog will exist after a year or so. Each post would be representative of what I was thinking about during that time.

I cannot, on a weekly basis, type up every contemplation. That consumes too much time and sanity. I must isolate what I find most significant and type it into a single article. Repeat this process each week so that I fall into a consistent, productive rhythm.

Weekly articles forms part of this website's mission. Portfolio projects and resume building will carry on sporadically. Articles are something I can always guarantee. From my experience, each week always has something worth writing/typing about.

Excluding "Example Article", this marks my very first blog post. There is some risk to consider when committing to a weekly blog. I will encounter weeks that thinly spread my hours of productivity. The temptation to skip the blog for a week would arise. Personal self-discipline would determine whether I give in or push through.

Discipline is a career necessity. I need it for more than writing this blog. This blog serves to improve my self-discipline while constructing a mental timeline. Two birds one stone.

### My Corner of the Internet

In the Home introduction for this website, I mention "my corner of the internet". This phrase implies a small degree of freedom. With it I can add onto this website as preferred. Bare in mind, this makes me responsible for the website's success or failure. It can go either way and I only have myself to blame.

Hosting a single website is hardly worth priding in. The content I post on the website can change that. That said, I do intend to keep the scope of this website small. Posting thoughts, projects, and work-related documents defines its use-case.

I would like to see a crude user-login system so that people can interact with the website as themselves. These kinds of features are pending future development.

For the most part, I imagine this website as a notice board for sharing information relevant to me. Any project I invest massive amounts of time in would be a good example.

This website currently functions more as a resume than a public attraction. That will change with time. Humble beginnings for at least for the next several years.

With enough time, commitment, and development, this website will flourish. Improving my skills as a developer and writer comes first however. An old saying states 10,000 hours as the bare minimum in time spent. Thing is, writing and developing are separate processes. 20,000 hours sounds much more reasonable for my ambitions.

Development occurs per code-related projects and updating this blog. Posts will of course occur weekly. My goal for each article is ~1000 words, and those words must be meaningful without filler.

### Technologies Backing this Blog

This Website runs off of NodeJS and Express. I use Angular to streamline Front End development. A cloud-hosted MongoDB database saves persistent information like user comments and messages.

NodeJS is my strongest programming language. I have experience with Java/C++. It turns out these languages see a lot of use in formal schooling. Another nice thing about Node is JavaScript. Knowledge of Front End JavaScript translates well into Back End Node scripting.

My skills with React outweigh Angular. I built most of my hobby projects using React after all. I decided to try out Angular for this blog, and I must say, I enjoy the technology. I cannot say I like it more than React. Even so, Google successfully streamlined Front End development, workflow, and testing with Angular. The Front End framework has a bright future ahead of it. I will keep using it at least for this blog.

What about MongoDB? Why NoSQL over SQL? I have nothing against SQL tables. My first internship had me formatting data into excel tables. These tables were then loaded by SQL scripts.

MongoDB meshes nicely with Node and Angular. Hence why the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node) stack exists. The format of NoSQL is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON syntax mirrors that of Node's Objects.

A native library of JSON methods installs with Node. These are the same methods available in traditional Front End JavaScript. The two most famous of the bunch being JSON.stringify(...) and JSON.parse(...).

The best-case scenario for MongoDB would have been as an in-memory database. Though implementable, it would have been a hassle to setup.

I cycle this application between two separate machines. A cloud-based solution lets this web application connect regardless of the file-system. It benefits convenience. This is another aspect that will likely change in future development cycles.

### Author and Developer

Let me start this section by saying that I lack the qualifications of a real author and developer. In 20,000 hours that may change. Author and developer is a title I wish to earn with enough hard work translating into ~20,000 hours. Projects like this blog form the beginning of my 20,000 hour journey.

Chasing these long-term goals involves many short-term objectives. Week-by-week I need to set my sights on getting things done. Accomplishments by which to measure progress help maintain motivation. Momentum is key and that means keeping the ball rolling.

These past couple days exemplify lost motivation. I literally fell flat on my face trying to get the ball rolling yesterday (imagine a head hitting a table). Today has gone much better, but I still feel guilty for days like yesterday where I fail. Those days happen every know and then when pursuing mastery.

Writing down a list of objectives makes getting started for the day easier. Planning out what to do before proceeding alleviates so much frustration.

I take solace in the process: start, struggle, progress, and stop. Over many days it evolves into trusting the process altogether. I do not want to undermine all my efforts up until now by compromising trust. Mistakes are just as inevitable as triumphs. Sticking it out through the mistakes requires trusting/believing in myself.

### Conclusion

Thank you for reading through this first installment to my blog. I will work hard to improve these articles each week.

Come back next week where I will talk about internships. I have participated in two separate internships over the past year. Each one proved a distinct experience in both co-worker morale and office workload.

For stories to read up on and tips to take advantage of for internships, come back next Monday!
