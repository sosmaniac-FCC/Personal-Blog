College Internships
===================

My transition from high school to College was worrisome. I had to take on my first student loan where I would be owing more than $2000 to the government. I thought this was so risky yet very necessary.

I had no luck applying for scholarships offered by my College and home County. My funds from working the grocery store provided much-needed leeway for most of my College-related expenses. The financial burden was so surreal. It felt as if I was stepping into ice-cold water for the very first time. There was no going back.

My first instinct was my Checking Account. I believed that I had to replenish those funds. I jumped at the first opportunity to work at a University call center.

I had no idea what I was getting into. It turns out asking people for money over the phone was way beyond my sanity. It would have been much better if I had something to offer in return for money. That was not the case at this call center. Thankfully, I did succeed in securing very minor donations. Each success came at great cost to my sanity however. I tapped out of the job after a mere couple days.

I turned elsewhere in the University to earn some funds. I landed upon my first pseudo-internship with the University's Small Business Development Center. This position was not exactly money-making at 10 hours a week, $10 per hour. I no longer cared as much about the pay.

The work had me attending workshops and studying basic web development. These work/study experiences made the job worth much more than the pay. Earning money while performing engaging work was possible even if not financially optimal. I had done the numbers realizing that my financials were not that bad, so I went all-in with the internship while pursuing my College studies.

The people running the internship program were very kind. The things I did there were not always beneficial but neither were they harmful. I dedicated days to learning the ins-and-outs of Front End development concepts. This was not productive from a business perspective. From a personal perspective, it meant becoming a better programmer.

What made the learning process all the more fulfilling was the people overseeing my efforts. They actually approved of my studies. This motivated me to keep learning especially during the downtime.

In fact, I spent so much time beyond the weekly 10 hours learning how to program. I got to the point where I could develop a website from scratch. Unfortunately, the website my bosses had in mind for me to develop never surfaced. Other business concerns took priority.

I wrote multiple reports instead. They offered insight into the various cybersecurity workshops I attended. It turns out small businesses are very susceptible to cyber crime. The workshops discussed various methods to improve cybersecurity posture from a business standpoint.

Distilling workshop details into simple reports became my way of helping out. The reports were convenient for some of the other interns from my University's College of Business. I myself hailed from the College of Engineering.

Other than those reports, there was a whole lot of downtime. I dedicated every bit of it to learning Front End Development with ReactJS. My first exposure with React led to months of studying and practicing its core concepts.

Several months later, my first College semester was coming to an end alongside my first internship. It was time for Winter Break. With the skills developed during my internship, I built several websites. Each one was inspired by the [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

Moving past Winter break onto my next semester, I had a couple of finished websites to boost my resume with. These projects landed me my second internship going forward into the Summer. To be frank, I was extremely blessed to land this second internship. I daresay it was a miracle made possible through prayer, hard work, and the acknowledgement of a single recruiter.

The second internship was a level-up in experience and pay. The people, although completely unique from my first internship, were just as kind. This time around I got to work 40 hours a week at $15 per hour. Hallelujah!

With this second internship, I received my first taste of the real-world. I worked with two other senior-level developers on many different projects. Across many weeks, I learned so much from these two mentors not only in terms of technology, but also in regards to everyday life skills. I will cherish their compassion forever.

Simply put, internships are indescribably valuable.

## My Message to the Reader

If not successful at first, apply, apply, and apply again for internships. If you are not applying, then study something that interests you. If that means Web Development, learn JavaScript/HTML/CSS plus a server-side scripting language. If game development, jump straight into C#/Unity and build a basic game. If data visualization/analytics, download and try a business intelligence platform (QlikView, Tableau, etc), and maybe program some visualizations from scratch. If machines and hardware, learn Python or C++/C and make those robots do something!

All that said, try to keep some limits in mind. If I go anywhere past the 70-80 hours of weekly work/study, I start to lose track. I typically schedule 60-70 hours each week, most of which is unpaid. This explains my lack of income excluding periods of internship.

Besides programming, I still like to listen to my favorite shows, read, sleep, eat, and relax. I like planning out each day as a way of saying, "I am going to spend this much time programming and that much time doing everything else." This approach to scheduling is as flexible as it is productive.

Oh right, I almost forgot to mention College. College feels more like a resume booster than a skill booster for internships. My opinion may change over the course of next year. The first year of College tends to lack a lot of programming courses.

95% of the skills used in my previous two internships were self-taught. While College teaches some interesting stuff, most of it does not matter in the business world. Again, given another year I may completely change my mind. Regardless of my opinion, the Internet covers every bit of useful information. The only catch being you have to search for it. I suggest starting/continuing your journey [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## Final Words of Advice

If you are graduating from high school and contemplating a Computer Science degree, go for it. You can earn the degree while self-teaching, which results in the best of both worlds. There is a good chance you will lose out on scholarships if you opt for coding bootcamp.

If you are switching careers, skip College for a coding bootcamp. You could also embark on the entirely self-taught route. Use the Internet and its free resources to their full potential.

Self-teach yourself as much as possible no matter what you decide. Teaching yourself new material will carry you through the rest of your career. Learning must ensue as technologies come-and-go.

In College, you should be perfecting your craft so that you can tackle the real world. I understand working retail/fast-food/server positions provide a solid source of income, but what if you could earn that same income while kick-starting your career?

Internships allow for that. I have no regrets about my past two internships. I hope to undertake several more. Nothing is ever guaranteed. Yet I take heart in curving the chances of failure with each passing hour of programming. You can do the same starting today.
