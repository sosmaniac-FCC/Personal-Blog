Fall Semester
=============
##### 08/27/2018

![Fall Walkway](../../assets/articles/images/stock_fall_walkway.jpg)

The first day of classes has concluded. My University's computer science program is currently larger than ever. Familiar faces I have not seen in months are now a near-daily occurrence. New construction is happening everywhere on campus. Everything feels so different compared to last week and the previous two semesters.

I failed to comprehend it the first time around, but University life feels so brittle. It somehow manages to exist off of students' fortunes or lack there-of in the case of student loans.

Granted, University costs are somewhat justified. University exposes people to the peaks of achievable skill and knowledge concerning most professions. People ply themselves against so many different professions wherein each boasts an incredibly high proficiency-ceiling.

One of the first proficiency-based professions I can think of is painting. A master painter is as obvious as the mid-day sun. I can behold his or her work ontop of a canvas and easily discern the painter's level of proficiency. That said, I would not qualify to give a professional art opinion. Regardless, I have attempted enough paintings to appreciate those who can make the paintbrush sing.

The idea of mastery, as exemplified with painting, is my motto for this semester. I want to produce the rough equivalent of a painted masterpiece in terms of programmatic logic. That may mean my biggest project yet. Perhaps it means going above and beyond in my classes. I am not 100% sure yet. Truth be told, I may lack the necessary experience to produce masterpieces. That does not mean I cannot try.

My class schedule lists 19 credit hours of both computer science and mathematics. This is the sort of challenge I need to push myself towards programmatic mastery. The pursuit of mastery offers unparalled fulfillment matched only by its difficulty to pursue.

I will keep at it as best as I can. Even now I am running short on time to write and publish this article due to classes. I apologize for stopping short. Trust me when I say that I will manage my time better for next Monday's blog post/article.
